## PRIME NUMBER GENERATOR

### THE PURPOSE OF THIS PRORGAM
### This program is designed to identify prime numbers on a scale of 2-100. 
### THE INPUT
### The input of this program is an integer input with a limit up to 100. The program will detect prime numbers from there.
### THE OUTPUT
### The output of the program is an updated and appended list of prime numbers found between 2-100.
### TYPE OF EXECUTION
### This program is a sequentially executed program with a deterministic outcome, due to the number limit.
### Ways to Improve - Remove limits. Further utility with Prime number generator. Add in options for different ranges.


## PASCAL TRIANGLE

### THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM
### Create a Pyramid that resembles Pascal's pyramid, utilizing python's factorial function and the nCr formula for binomial coefficients.
### THE INPUT
### The input of this program is the desired number of rows stored in the variable n.
### THE OUTPUT
### The output of the program is Pascal's pyramid, dependent on the number of rows the user inputs.
### TYPE OF EXECUTION
### Sequential Execution.
### Ways to Improve - Program suffers when inputing massive numbers. Add in user interface, adjustments for numbers on the extneral ring of pyramid, etc.
